  <p> A Situation of Conflict</p></h4>
<p>There is always a time in your life where you find yourself in a conflicting situation. One of the most significant conflicts in my life was my decision to move to the USA for college against my parents' will. They were very hesitant because of the financial investment of a private liberal arts college (even on scholarship), and also about the dangers of my being alone in such a "wild" country.</p>

<p>As I would attempt to convince them of the opportunities I would benefit from, it seems as though all they cared about was my safety. This situation was rather conflicting, because on one hand, I knew where they came from. If I was a parent and my only child wanted to go study in a other continent and eventually stay for a career, I would be wary and make sure that she/he would carefully consider this choice and be well prepared. On the other hand, I could not understand why they would not even give me this chance. I had proven to them that I was a cautious, intelligent, street-smart and responsible person, but I felt like their overprotectiveness towards me was preventing me from any opportunities that would greatly benefit me in the long run, and generally from any new life experiences.</p>

<p>I felt angry and frustrated, and spent days without talking to them, slowly becoming more distant. Eventually, I realized that this reaction was childish and not very productive, mostly being the result of immediate emotions rather than careful consideration. I realized that to be more succesful, in family as well as in work relationships, I need to be more in control of your emotions, and think of the most diplomatic approach to solving any conflict with someone.</p>

<p>I chose to write down on paper my reasons for making this choice, which will inadvertently be a decisive one for the many years to come. By writing them down clearly and concisely, my parents will know that it is not a choice I am making on a whim. I wanted them to see that I had thought out of every possible option, and prepared for any possible situations that may arise, good or bad.</p>
<p>For every choice, I wrote the pros and cons, and for every con, I would write a solution- just like a lawyer would do in order to plead for a case.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<em>
<p>1) Going to the USA to benefit from excellent education and benefit from the holistic learning exprerience of a campus environment.</p>
<p>Pros: excellent education, great job potential, chances to build solid connexions.</p>
<p>Cons: education isn't as good as expected, bad influences.</p>
  <br>Con-solution: Only go to the USA if I get accepted to a top college with excellent faculty. Smartest minds in the nations will decrease the likelihood of bad influences. Will communicate frequently to my parents during the first months so that they know my whereabouts (if this makes them feel better).
</em>

<p>And this how I went about to solve one of the most important conflicts in my life.</p>
