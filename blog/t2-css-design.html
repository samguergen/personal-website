<p> HTML & CSS</p></h4>
 <p> HTML is a front-end web language that allows users to design that web page. HTML works with 'tags' that are used to surround the content of the webpage, and through these tags they can style, color, create shapes and position their content as they wish. It is practical for making a webpage pretty and readable.</p>
  <p>CSS works hands in hands with HTML and makes it easier for a user to design his page, by avoiding repeated formatting. HTML can get pretty tedious, as a user has to write code for every detail of his design.</p>
 <p> If a user has a common design he is using for different elements in his webpage, or a common format accross different webpage, CSS allows the user to 'box' these different elements together (giving them a common class name) and create the common design/format on a separate CSS page. This not only avoids repetition, but also confusing, as it instantly becomes easier for a user to track his changes. Each 'class', or group of element with a common design, are showed clearly and separately on the CSS page. </p>

<p>This screenshot should give you a good example</p>

<p> Margins, borders and paddings are an important aspect of element positioning via CSS.</p>
  <p> The margin represents the space around the box where the content is located. It controls how much spacing the user wants to have around his box of text and consequently how he wants the boxes to be displayed on his webpage.
<p> The border represents the line around the box, and formatting the border allows a user to customize its thickness, if it should be solid or dashed, its color, and even its border radius (how round its corners should be).</p>
  <p>The padding represents the space inside the box, separating the text and the border. It's important to note that the padding element is only used to adjust the position of the text within the box. To make the padding a certain color, the user must use the "background-color" element.</p>

<p>Here is a diagram representing these 3 features (source: Chrome DevTools)</p>
