<p> Stereotype Threat</p></h4>

<img src="imgs/stereothreat.png" style="width:500px"/>

<p> I was lucky enough to have been raised in a privileged environment. I was educated in one of the best schools in Europe, where people of all background and nationalities were studying together and most students were very smart. My college experience at Wellesley was pretty much similar.</p>

  <p>However, after I graduated and started working in Information Technology, I started experiencing an indirect form of stereotype threat. Not the typical "you made a mistake, that's because you are a minority woman" stereotype threat, but a more subtle one.
    <br>There were times when I would work remotely from a wifi cafe. I would begin to notice the curious stares, exaggerated attention and moments of disbelief from the people around me as I was silently working on my laptop.
    <br>What was it about me that could make them so doubtful or surprised that I could be smart?
    <br>Was it the fact that I was a minority, a women, or perhaps both?
  </p>

  <p>Trying not to take it to the heart, I would convince myself that not everyone was lucky enough to be open-minded and intelligent. However, there were times when I have witnessed it affecting me. I felt like I was being watched under the microscope and consequently, I would become more agitated and it was harder to focus on my work.
  <br> I almost felt like I was a performer, working for the entertainement of the crowd.</p>

  <p> I can very much relate to others feeling stereotype threat, not only from my type of stereotype threat, but from other types too, because it doesn't solely depend on the gender, ethnicity, or the physical appearance in general. You can feel threatened by only talking, thinking, or <em>believing</em> a certain way. </p>

  <p>But as my friend would say: "Stop being a victim!".
  <br>Although there isn't much to do to change people's prejudices, you can do something to change your own attitude towards them.
  <br>You should, of course, continue to ignore these people, but you should also change your mindset to a more forgiving and hopeful one.
  <br> It's helpful to realize that we are in an ever-changing society, and whether or not you know it, every action you do has a consequence on the future generation.
  <br>Ignorant people may be surprised to see me working on a laptop, but next time they go to a cafe and see another minority girl working on her laptop, they will get more used to it, which will influence their behavior. This, in turn, will give the girl more confidence, and there you go - a lovely butterly effect! </p>

  <p>Let's not forget, finally, that as ignorant as some of the  population may be, the USA is still a fast-growing country with surprising discoveries and policies that are made everyday. The society as a whole is used to fast changes, and slowly opening up to the possibility that truly <em>anyone</em> can be smart and successful. Isn't that what this country is about, anyway? ;-) </p>

<p>Optimistically, </p>
