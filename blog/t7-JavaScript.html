  <p>Looping in Javscript vs. looping in Ruby</p></h4>
      <p>
        One of the most useful features of the Ruby language is that it allows sophisticated looping. With a variety of pre-packaged enumerators like .sort  to .map, you have many ways of iterating through an object, without having to write a pre-defined function for it.</p>
       <p><div class="quote">refer to my <a href="t4-enumerable-methods.html">blog post</a> on Ruby enumerators</div></p>

       <p>In addition to saving you many lines of code, an advantage of using these pre-packages methods is that they make your code easier to read. Since their function are explicitely defined by their name, it's clearer to get an idea of the general flow of the code.
        <br>On the contrary, building enumerators 'from scratch' generally require more nested "for" and "while" loops, which can be more confusing to read.</p>

       <p>However, Ruby's pre-packaged methods can be taken for granted, especially for novice coders. Since they are required for elegant refactoring in Ruby, coders are adviced to use them a lot. By doing so, they may not find it necessary to understand the internal logic of the loop.
        <br>Metaphorically, we can compare this with memorizing a mathematical theorem without understanding its proof. Although we can use the theorem in a variety of equations, our use of it will stay somewhat limited.</p>

      &nbsp

        <p>Looping in Javascript is much more straight-forward: only based on "for" and "while" loops. If we want to use a .sort or .map enumerator, we must first build them as separate functions.</p>

        <p>For example:</p>

        <img src="imgs/manualmap.png"/>

        <p>An advantage of using only these two types of loops is, as I started earlier, that it allows you to have a more thorough understanding of the logic of your code.</p>

        <p>Another advantage is that it makes it easier for you to switch to another programming language. Since "for" and "while" loops are common to all programming language (despite varying syntax), it's easier for you to familiarized yourself to a new language because you these basic loops to fall back on.</p>

        <p>A third advantage is that it gives you room for more customization. For example, you can define a map method that will map over every 2 elements. Technically, you can also do this in Ruby by writing your criteria in the {block} section, but with Javascript, you can add this critera as you define your own .map function, so that no blocks are required. As a result, building from scratch gives you somewhat more control and flexibility over your code. </p>

        <p>The downside of using Javascript "for" and "while" loops is that they tend to make your code longer, and harder to read. With less pre-packaged specification and more punctuation required- you have to be more attentive over minor syntactic details, instead of focusing all of your attention on the 'crunch'.</p>
        <p>In my opinion, programming languages like Javascript are always good to learn for starters, so that you avoid depending too much on pre-packaged method, but user-friendly languages like Ruby allow you to maximize your time.</p>
