<h4><center> Internet & Bias: a Double-edge Sword.</center></h4>
<h4>

<p>Having the opportunity to work in technology, and particularly in Internet-related technology is a God-given gift. With your skills and your creativity, you have the chance to make the world a better place.
  <br>One way, is facilitate the life of many people by providing an alternate, more practical way to use everyday tools. For example, you could build a virtual cookbook app for someone to store every new ideas they have, or an app for organizing notes.
  <br>Another way, is to educate the youth by building educational website, or social platforms, where people from around the world can share their knowledge. As a result, many share the utopian standpoint that Internet is a tool for opening people's mind and breaking cultural biases. </p>

<p>But is it <em>really</em>?</p>

<p>In fact, Internet is more like a double-edge sword. Through the sharing of information, it can indeed provide a window to the world. If you don't have the chance to travel much, it's a good way to keep up with current events.</p>

<p>The problem is that instead of giving you all of this information as a bouquet -much like a university providing a full-stack curriculum with a variety of subjects to choose from- with Internet, you need to find them yourself. And when you are the one searching for information, no matter how objective this information is, you are already being <em>selective</em> about these topics. Selection is subjectivity...of sorts.</p>

<p>In addition to requiring being selective, Internet also provides a dangerous tool, for extremists or hateful people. Here is why: if you already have a certain extreme view, for example, hate for Islam or for African-Americans, you will <em>almost always</em> find some information to back you up. After searching, you will immediately find websites that supports your side and give you even more reason to hate a particular group. Worst, you may become more confident in your twisted opinion, as now have all sorts of source to 'back you up'. So while internet can be window to the world, it can also be...a window to Hell.</p>

<p>Internet is very powerful and will increasingly influence the opinions of generations to come. While it may be difficult to filter out content, we need, first and foremost, to educate the youth on <em>how</em> to search content, for example, by finding views that both support <em>and</em> counter their argument,  look at different types of sources across voices from different political, social and cultural sides, trust the more accredited writers, as opposed to mainstream 'bloggers'. And most importantly...question <em>everything</em>.
<br>As practical as Internet may be, I think that nothing beats traveling, learning languages (3 is not enough for me!) and of course... the smell and comfort of a good university library :) </p>
