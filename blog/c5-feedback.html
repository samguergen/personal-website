 <p> Pairing and Feedback</p></h4>

  <p> My pairing experience at DBC has been going very well so far. I was lucky enough to be with intelligent, understanding, patient, and kind people who expressed themselves clearly and concisely, making the sessions both pleasant and productive. Each new insight from a partner was expressed in a fashion that was clearly understood by the other, and by such, we join forces to first generate steps for our solutions, and then write our code in the most elegant way. For each pairing, we were also able to evenly alternate our roles as drivers and navigator, which helped us bring different perspectives to the challenges.. </p>

<p> Nonethless, pairing remotely has his limits. Because we used sharing platforms for our challenges such as Stypi, or just simple screen sharings on top our video sessions, it made it sometimes difficult to keep track of what the other person was doing at a given time. For example, during times in which we would both think of the best way to formulate a statement, one partner would do some research, add a test code, or load the program on their own, without feeling the necessity to share every detail of it. This would lead to some misunderstandings when explaining the method just researched to be used in the code. On the other hand, if we were sitting next to each other, I could simply lean over their computer to look at what they are doing. Another limit of pairing remotely is of course the sound or image quality of video session, and the lack of 'presence' of the other partner. </p>

<p> The feedback that I received from my partners as a result of our pairing session were, for the most part, just as DBC recommends: Specific, Actionable and Kind (SAK). They are specific in the sense that they describe on point certain details about the session in order to support a particular comment or suggestion. They were actionable in the sense that they advised me on what I could change or do better the next time. They were kind in the sense that they always remained positive and encouraging.</p>
<p> When writing my own feedbacks for my partner, I tried to follow the same SAK model. The ratings I received for my feedbacks mostly agreed that I was respecting these criteria. In the beginning, however, I did have some trouble with writing kind feedbacks. In french culture, it is customs to be as straight-forward as possible in professional matters, and being overly nice can be viewed as superfluous and hypocrite. I learned to make the difference between a "nice" and a "kind" comment. In DBC feedback culture, "kind" has more to do with staying positive and encouraging to the partner, as opposed to just "nice" for the sake of being nice.
