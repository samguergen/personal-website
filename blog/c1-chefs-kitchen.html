      So far, it seems as though DBC is an intensive learning experience, where we will be spending a lot of hours coding and learning new concepts. DBC seems to be not just about sitting in a class and listening to teachers, but also about pairing and working together in a strong collaborative environment.
      This is precisely what I am looking for in this experience. I know that learning computer software will be challenging and that our best results will come from collaboration. There is a reason why most computer programmers collaborate!

      After watching the Fireside Chat, I was positively surprised by DBC's focus on personal growth, and not just about the learning and the curriculum as a 'purchased package'. We are all throwing ourselves together in this intensive bootcamp and the struggle and stress we will be experiencing will also teach us about our own limits, maximize our learning, and how to take out the best of this experience. Although we will be gulping a lot of information, it's indeed true that we won't be experts in only 3 months, and a big part of the experience is also learning more on our own and practicing, practicing and practicing. I'm  a bit nervous, but surely excited to start!
