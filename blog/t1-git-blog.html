<p> Version control, Git and Github.</p></h4>
    <p>
      Version control allows a user to keep track of the edits she makes to a project. This can be useful if, for instance, she realizes she has made an error and wants to go back to an older version of the project to fix this error. It is also useful if she is unsure of when she made certain changes, and wants to view the history of her edits in order to have better control over them. In a way, version control is like a 'saving point management program'.

      However, it's important to note that instead of tracking and saving every unit of changes -such as every letter typed, which would make it quite daunting to track anything-  the user chooses when to bundle up - aka commit- her changes in order to save them altogether into this saving point.

Finally, version control allows more than one user to easily collaborate together on the same project. Pulling edits from the original project to the cloned version she is working on, allows a user to not overlap her edits with those of her coworkers. This can save a considerable amount of time as it avoids their constantly having to communicate to let each other know the changes they are making, and which part of the project they are working on.

    <p>
        git is the most popular and widely use type of version control. It allows users to keep track of their changes locally, meaning on their own machine, through the command line window. The commands that git uses are very intuitive and easy to remember, and even if we are unsure of how to perform, we can always type 'help' or 'man' in the command line in order to receive complete instructions of the said commands.

        git also interacts with online platforms such as Github, to download, synchronize, push, or pull content between the user's local files and her remote ones. The remote location of a file can be anything from a Github repository, to an email inbox- and is commonly known as a 'cloud' storage.

Github is an online platform that allows users to code socially using version control. In a way, it is an online equivalent of git, meaning that it provides storage and version control through the internet, instead of on your machine.

It is useful to use Github to store your code because it allows you to access your code from any machine that has internet. You simply need to log into Github. Github files can also be used locally through git (by downloading, or 'cloning' the files from the terminal using git) but it is important to synchronise all the changes we make.

Finally, Github is a great way to improve your code if you are willing to accept inputs and recommendations from others. This is called open source, and by making your project (Github calls it 'repository') public to others, the public can fork a copy of it and improve your code before submitting these changes for you to approve them.
